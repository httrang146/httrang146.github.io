    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The project analyzes the Olist e-commerce dataset to explore sales trends and delivery performance. It aims to uncover actionable insights that can support better decision-making in sales strategies and logistics operations.</p>
    <p>The analysis is intended for the sales and logistics teams. Sales managers can use the insights on order patterns and sales trends to refine their strategies, while logistics teams can leverage delivery performance analysis to optimize operations and reduce delays.</p>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>To analyze order patterns and delivery performance in order to identify trends, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improving sales and logistics processes.</p>
    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>Founded in 2014, Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small businesses across the country to multiple sales channels through a single contract. Merchants list their products in the Olist Store and ship orders directly to customers using Olist‚Äôs logistics partners. After a purchase is made, sellers are notified to fulfill the order. Once the product is delivered‚Äîor the estimated delivery date has passed‚Äîthe customer receives a satisfaction survey via email, where they can rate their shopping experience and leave feedback.</p>
    <h3>Role</h3>
    <p>Data Analyst ‚Äì responsible for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating visualizations to extract and communicate insights.</p>
    <h3>Tools and Methodologies</h3>
    <p>Python, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization, Statistics</p>
    <h2>Insights</h2>
    <h3>Sales</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Demand was low at the end of 2016, then rose steadily through 2017 with clear seasonality, peaking at about <span class="highlight-purple">1,200 daily orders on Black Friday</span>, before flattening in 2018 at  <span class="highlight-purple">around 6,500 monthly orders</span>.</li>
      <li>Operational performance improved sharply, as the <span class="highlight-red">Cancelled Rate fell from 8% in 2016 to 1% in 2017‚Äì2018</span>, the <span class="highlight-yellow">Unavailable Rate declined from 2% to 0%</span>, and the <span class="highlight-green">Fulfillment Rate increased from 81% to 98%</span>.</li>
      <li>Revenue also grew strongly, with <span class="highlight-blue">GMV reaching 5.96M in 2017</span> and already surpassing that in just the first eight months of 2018 at <span class="highlight-blue">7.22M</span>, averaging <span class="highlight-blue">0.8‚Äì0.9M per month</span>.</li>
      <li>The <span class="highlight-blue">Average Order Value ranged between $120‚Äì150</span>, spiking to about <span class="highlight-blue">$337</span>, while weekday afternoons (especially Monday‚ÄìWednesday) drove the highest order volumes, and <span class="highlight-blue">Thursday evenings and Friday afternoons</span> recorded the highest AOV.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Logistics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Olist shows strong delivery performance, with an <span class="highlight-blue">average Delivery Lead Time of 10 days</span>, including <span class="highlight-blue">1‚Äì4 days inbound</span> and <span class="highlight-blue">4‚Äì12 days outbound</span>. This balance keeps the overall delivery process efficient.</li>
      <li>The on-time delivery rate is high: <span class="highlight-green">90.4% for customers</span> and <span class="highlight-green">82.4% for carriers</span>. Only <span class="highlight-red">9.6%</span> of orders were late, mainly caused by <span class="highlight-red">carriers (62.6%)</span> rather than <span class="highlight-red">sellers (37.8%)</span>.</li>
      <li>Deliveries made on time are associated with <span class="highlight-yellow">higher customer review scores</span>, highlighting the importance of punctual logistics.</li>
      <li>Geographically, most <span class="highlight-purple">customers</span> are in the <span class="highlight-purple">east</span>, while <span class="highlight-purple">sellers</span> are concentrated in the <span class="highlight-purple">southeast</span>. Delivery lead time is <span class="highlight-red">longest in the northwest</span> but <span class="highlight-green">shortest in the southeast</span>, where Olist‚Äôs GMV is also highly concentrated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Olist should <span class="highlight-purple">upsell or launch new products</span> to increase order volume during <span class="highlight-purple">weekdays</span> in the <span class="highlight-purple">afternoon (12h‚Äì17h)</span>.</li>
      <li>Olist should promote <span class="highlight-green">higher-priced products</span> on <span class="highlight-green">Thursday evenings</span> and <span class="highlight-green">Friday afternoons</span>, for example through Premium Brand Days or Golden Hour campaigns.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight-purple">Afternoon peak hours</span> (see slide 22) are ideal for pushing <span class="highlight-purple">promotions</span> via banners, notifications, flash sales, or calls to action.</li>
      <li>Olist should keep <span class="highlight-blue">Delivery Lead Time</span> short in the southeast to sustain the largest GMV, while also improving lead times in distant states‚Äîpotentially by <span class="highlight-blue">creating regional hubs</span> to reduce cost.</li>
      <li>Olist should collect additional datasets, including:
        <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight-blue">Distance data</span> to analyze routes and improve delivery speed.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight-yellow">Discount</span> and promotion data to assess their impact on GMV.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight-purple">User demographic data</span> to better understand customers and drive higher GMV.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
